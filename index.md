The Dogs vs. Cats dataset is a standard computer vision dataset that involves classifying photos as either containing a dog or cat. This problem can be effectively approached thanks to innovations in deep learning through convolutional neural networks. I developed multiple models for photo classification using transfer learning and ended up employing Resnet50, VGG16, and Xception architectures.

[Breast Cancer Classification with Nested CV](https://baileythill.github.io/Notebooks/Breast-Cancer-Classification.html)
<br><br>
According to the CDC, about 264,000 cases of breast cancer are diagnosed in women and about 2,400 in men in the US each year. I have seen this type of cancer's impact in my own family and thus found the Wisconsin-Breast Cancer (Diagnostics) dataset (WBC) from UCI machine learning repository to be an interesting opportunity to employ Machine Learning techniques. I used neested Cross-validation for KNN and SVM to tackle this classification problem and developed a model with 98% accuracy.
